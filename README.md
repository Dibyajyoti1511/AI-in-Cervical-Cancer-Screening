# AI-in-Cervical-Cancer-Screening

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of an explainable AI model for cervical cancer detection from Pap smear images. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate classification and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for interpretability, this project focuses on making the deep learning model's decisions transparent and trustworthy for medical professionals. The goal is to bridge the gap between performance and interpretability in medical AI applications.
